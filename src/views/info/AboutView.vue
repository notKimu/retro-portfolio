                A young && smol software developer that likes messing around with computers and software.
                <br><br>
                
                Currently I am learning about Linux systems and building my own servers from scratch, I love 
                using old computers as servers.
                <br><br>

                As of sotfware, I like coding Discord bots and Minecraft plugins.
                <br>
                Rust and TypeScript are my main programming languages, I am trying to find others that I like but
                I end up returning to these two... Always.
